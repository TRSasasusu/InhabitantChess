## Rules (i think)
(?) - unimplemented but possible rule

three piece types: **Eye**, **Antler**, **Blocker**
- **Eye**: goal of the antler player, also their greatest threat
    - beam - removes all antlers hit by it from the board
    - infinite range across all tiles (3 lines, like how queen moves/poses a threat in chess)
- **Antler**: basically just a pawn for now
    - (?) can enter blocker for protection
    - (?) goal is to reach/contain the eye w the help of blockers
- **Blocker**: 
    - can block eye's beam from entering any spaces behind it
    - used to protect antler pieces

2 players: one controls the Eye, other controls Antler/Blockers

(?) game ends when eye removes all antlers or the eye is reached/contained
