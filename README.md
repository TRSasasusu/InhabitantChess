## How to Encounter
Trigger the "Dreamworld" ending (time loop disabled + trapped in simulation), then head to the Prisoner's vault.

The player can choose to end the game by getting up from the table and talking to the Prisoner directly.

After the game ends and the player has said farewell, a shortcut will unlock at the starting camp.

## Rules (i think)
(?) - unimplemented but possible rule

three piece types: **Eye**, **Antler**, **Blocker**
- **Eye**: goal of the antler player, their greatest (and only) threat
    - beam - removes all antlers hit by it from the board
    - infinite range across all tiles (3 lines, like how queen moves/poses a threat in chess)
    - can be "contained" when all legal moves are blocked by the player's pieces
- **Antler**: basically just a pawn for now
    - used to reach the eye - once eye is contained by at least one antler piece
    - (?) can enter blocker for protection
- **Blocker**:
    - used to protect antler pieces
    - can block eye's beam from entering any spaces behind it

2 players: one controls the Eye, other controls Antler/Blockers

The game ends when the player runs out of Antler pieces or reaches the Eye.
