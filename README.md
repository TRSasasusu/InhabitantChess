## How to Encounter
on their first try, player has to collect warp core from ATP and make it to the stranger

arrive, proceed to open vault or wtv (ill allow cheating to get in anyway) and proceed as normal

after completing vision exchange, prisoner howls and then moves toward elevator, turns and
asks you for the vision staff - interrupted by our code which replaces it with a dialogue prompt

then move to place the vision staff against the table, fade to black and then 
setup environment (screeching noises etc. and then prisoner is seated across from
the table)

player can choose to end the game by getting up from the table and interacting with
the prisoner separately, then allow game to trigger simulation ending

in subsequent loops - just hit a button near spawn or something. like a flying artifact

log entries record meeting them, maybe update with high score? A Tired Ghost
## Rules (i think)
(?) - unimplemented but possible rule

three piece types: **Eye**, **Antler**, **Blocker**
- **Eye**: goal of the antler player, also their greatest threat
    - beam - removes all antlers hit by it from the board
    - infinite range across all tiles (3 lines, like how queen moves/poses a threat in chess)
- **Antler**: basically just a pawn for now
    - (?) can enter blocker for protection
    - (?) goal is to reach/contain the eye w the help of blockers
- **Blocker**: 
    - can block eye's beam from entering any spaces behind it
    - used to protect antler pieces

2 players: one controls the Eye, other controls Antler/Blockers

(?) game ends when eye removes all antlers or the eye is reached/contained
